========================= Library using MySQL ==================================

==================> How does it work?

- The player can read or buy books

- Books are filtered by category end ordered by title

- Books are dematerialized : no custom blueprints are needed
	Books are created with a base blueprint and modified with the information
	in the database

- You can have multiple libraries containing different books

- Recently added books are marked with a N (stands for New)

- Books are stored in the db with :
	code : (unique & mandatory) used for the book blueprint ans as the book
			identifier
	date : Date when the book has been added
	libtag : libraries tags that possess the book
			multiple tags are separated with a comma ","
			To display a book in all libraries, enter "*"
	price : Cost of the book
	icon : Number of the icon (see notes). Optional
	cat : Category name of the book (ex : Monsters, Module, ...)
	source : Source of the book (HRP) (Wikipedia, Gemmaline, ...).
			if ='', will not be shown in the book
	author : Writer of the book (RP) (ex : Elminster, Volo, ...)
			if ='', will not be shown in the book
	title : Book's title
	text : Book's content, up to 10000 char
	
	





==================> Installation

NWN :
	- Import Scripts.erf (contains gui_library.nss and library_onused.nss)
	- Import [LANGUAGE]/Scripts.erf (contains library_inc.nss)
	- Assign 'library_onused' to the OnUsed script of the placeable to click to
		browse the books (and remember the placeable tag ;))
	- Put [LANGUE]/library.xml into the folder documents/nwn2/ui/custom
	- If there is already a file named "ingamegui.ini" in documents/nwn2/ui/custom,
		add the folowing line at the end of [MandatoryGUI] :
		    SCREEN_LIBRARY=library.xml
		else add the "ingamegui.ini" from the svn into documents/nwn2/ui/custom


MySQL :
	using the library require a nwnx4 server and a SQL database & table ;)
	To create the needed table, execute this request :
			CREATE TABLE `library` (
			  `code` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
			  `date` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
			  `libtag` varchar(45) default '*',
			  `price` int(6) default '10',
			  `icon` int(11) default '229',
			  `cat` varchar(45) default 'Other',
			  `source` varchar(45) default '',
			  `author` varchar(45) default '',
			  `title` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
			  `text` varchar(10000) NOT NULL,
			  PRIMARY KEY  (`code`)
			) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8

	Note : You can execute the script in [LANGUAGE]/Books.sql to add some sample
			books
