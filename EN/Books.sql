She is one of the more powerful members of the Seldarine. The Lady of Dreams actively opposes the nefarious schemes of the Spider Queen and the other drow powers. She is said to be the wife of Corellon Larethian. Sehanine lives in the realm of Arvandor  As befits the elven goddess of mysteries, Sehanine is cloaked in secrets and illusions and rarely speaks her mind directly, preferring to communicate through a process of dreams, visions, and other mystic experiences. The Goddess of Moonlight is truly spiritual and ephemeral being who evades any attempt to define her and whose serenity surrounds her like a mantle of moondust.  Worshipers of Sehanine Moonbow seek out and destroy undead creatures, for Sehanine holds such creatures -- with the notable exceptions of baelnorn and other good-aligned undead beings who voluntarily prolong their existence in order to serve their kin -- to be blasphemous.'),

He never displays any emotion aside from anger and the occasional exulation after the death of an enemy. The Black Archer is disdainful of moderation in the pursuit of revenge, and will often strike preemptively against his foes.  The church of Shevarash is tiny, but rigidly disciplined. Clerics spend their days drilling, designing tactics, mapping out the Upper Underdark, and leading hit-and-run raids and assaults on drow territories. Clerics of the Black Archer pray for their spells at dusk, just as the drow sneak into the surface world. The holiest day of the year for the church is Midwinter Night, during which the Dark Court Slaughter is remembered. Inductions into the ranks of the clergy occur at this time. Each new cleric screams vows of vengeance into the night air and swears neither to laugh nor smile until the Spider Queen and her followers are no more.'),

He teaches his followers the arts of hunting; including archery, moving unseen and hiding in the wild places. He watches over the borders of wilderness and farmed land and seeks to maintain the balance between them. Solonor lives in the realm of Arvandor on the plane of Arborea.  Solonor is never in one place long, and is always hunting his quarry with his magical bow that can fire as far as the horizon and his quiver that never empties. He hunts not to kill for killings sake but to maintain the balance of nature and to destroy evil. He does not close with foes, but tracks them and shoots from a distance. He can create an arrow of slaying, and if this strikes home it will kill all enemies. Many fiends have fallen to a single shot.'),

Together with Sharrven it suppressed the spread of evil in Siluvanede and maintained the peace. Their land was bound by the eastern part of the High Forest from Turnstone Pass in the north to the Shining Falls in the south.  In 882 DR the combination of the demonic invasion that spilled forth from Ascalhorn, the continued assault of the Orc hordes, and the weakening of the kingdom by elves Retreating to Evermeet resulted in the kingdom''s collapse.  After the collapse some of the Elves of Eaerlann joined with Dwarves and Humans to form the Fallen Kingdom.  All that remains of the kingdom of Eaerlann is a crumbling old road and a ruined port.  The ''Council of the Wood'' is a group of wood elf elders and moon elf nobles who share a common dream of raising a new Eaerlann, a dream that is slowly coming to fruition. Through the group''s efforts the settlement of Talltrees (the ancient site of kingdom''s capital) was built and the new settlements of Reitheillaethor and Nordahaeril were founded. The Caerilcarn also cooperated with the army of Evermeet during the fey''ri invasion lead by Sarya Dlardrageth, successfully massing an army of wood elves at the Lost Peaks and breaking Sarya''s pursuing orcish forces. The Caerilcarn is headed by Morgwais, the Lady of the Wood, and is lead by its spokesman Yrind Morninglight.'),

Wood elves see themselves as guardians of the Tel-quessir forest homes that were largely abandoned after the Crown Wars and before the Retreat, but unlike most Tel-quessir they do not view themselves as a people apart from the rest of Faerûn.  Wood elves are easily identifiable by their coppery skin and green, brown, or hazel eyes. Wood elven hair is usually black or brown, although hues such as blond or copper red have also been observed. Wood elves tend to dress in simple clothes, similar to those of the moon elves but with fewer bold colors and a greater number of earth tones that blend into their natural surroundings. Accustomed to a harsh, naturalistic lifestyle, wood elves love to wear leather armor, even when they are not under immediate threat. Wood elves are roughly identical to other elves in height and build, with males larger than females.  Wood elves are often stronger than other Tel-quessir, including other elves, but are frequently less cerebral than the eladrin, who put a greater value on education.  As a people wood elves are largely seen as calm and level-headed. Arousing strong emotions in wood elves is not something that is easily done, although many do have a strong aversion for large cities, having lost the passion for urbanization after the fall of Earlann. To wood elves, the trappings of civilization, including the mightiest of fortresses or tallest walls, are transient and impermanent things that will eventually be overcome by the long processes of nature. To many, this attitude seems condescending, weakening the bonds between wood elves and other races. Additionally, wood elves can sometimes seem off-putting compared to other Tel-quessir, with a gruff manner that makes them less charismatic, in spite of their avowed compassion and humility.'),

Haughty and arrogant, sun elves typically feel themselves superior to most other races, including other Tel-quessir.  Like all of the Tel-quessir, the sun elves are close to the height of humans, but with notable differences. Sun elves have bronze-colored skin and hair most often of copper, golden blond, and black, with red more uncommon but heard of.  Sun elves, like other eladrin, typically have green eyes, though golden ones are also common, often with a liquid appearance, and silver, black, hazel, or copper hues have also been heard of.  Like their moon elven brethren, male sun elves are typically taller and heavier than females, sometimes by as much as five inches or twenty pounds.  Sun elves have a reputation for being stronger but less durable than other eladrin. This is not necessarily the case for all sun elves, however.'),

More tolerant of humans than other eladrin, moon elves are the ancestors of most half-eladrin.  Like all eladrin, the Teu-tel-quessir are tall, close to humans in height, but more slender and beautiful. Moon elf skin is pale, often with an icy blue hue. Moon elf hair is commonly black, blue, or silvery white, although human-like colors are heard of as well, though very rare. Moon elf eyes, like those of other eladrin, are very commonly green, although some are blue as well. All exhibit a characteristic best described as golden flecks speckled through the iris. Male moon elves are typically taller than females.'),

As of 1374 DR, they are an extremely insular race who remain close to nature and are rarely seen by other races. They have a heavier build and darker skin than other elf subraces despite having a similar average height.  Wild elves have darker skin than other elven subraces, in a range of light brown to black. An average male is 5''8" (173 cm) in height and weighs 150 lbs (68 kg), while an average female is 5''3" (160 cm) and 130 lbs (60 kg). Their hair can be anything from black to light brown, and it grays and turns to white with old age. They prefer to wear as little clothing as possible and choose instead to adorn themselves with other decorations like tattoos, feathers or body paint. They can make and wear complicated and intricate beadwork. Males are usually larger than females, sometimes by as much as five inches or twenty pounds, but wild elves differ little in size from other elves.  Wild elves, like other elves, are nimble and agile in body, but they are commonly thought of as less intelligent than their elven brethren, due in part to their aversion to civilization.'),

They lie roughly 400 miles (644km) West of the region of Amn and to the southwest of the Sword Coast. As of 1371 DR the majority of the Moonshae Isles are ruled by the High Queen Alicia Kendrick, who rules from the capital city of Caer Callidyrr on Alaronn.  The Moonshae Isles are populated mainly by the Ffolk and the Northlanders, two human societies, but there are a small number of Llewyrr elves living in isolation on the islands of Alaron and Gwynneth. Dwarves and halflings also populate the Moonshaes although their numbers are far smaller than the human occupants.'),

As such, her nature reflects traits of each of these deities. Due to the nature of her creation, Angharradh exhibits a fierce protectiveness and strong resolve. Despite her vigilance, the reversal of the Elven Retreat and the return of drow to Cormanthor have weakened Angharradh''s spirit while causing the three goddesses to spend more time apart.  The church of Angharradh is essentially the unified face of the three separate, but closely allied, churches of Aerdrie, Hanali and Sehanine. Most clerics of Angharradh are affiliated with at least one aspect of the Three, being considered wise women and sages, often being consulted when important issues arise. Clerics and druids of Angharradh pray for their spells at a time of their choosing, but it must be the time when they pray to one of the three goddesses. The clergy celebrate the holy days and important ceremonies of one of the Three, depending upon which aspect they venerate.'),

While she delights in creating unpredictable weather, including some fairly severe thunderstorms, her primary joy is simply to feel the air around her as she flies high above the ground. Somewhat distant, Aerdrie seldom involves herself in culture of her fellow deities. Somewhat disregarding the other elves of Faerûn, Aerdrie concerns herself with the affairs of the few remaining avariel. Though often thought of and treated as though a goddess, Aerdrie Faenya is, in fact, the fey-oriented aspect The church of Aerdrie Faenya is small, with little organization and only a few scattered temples. The clergy are primarily concerned with exploration and maintaining good relations with other sentient avian races such as giant eagles and aarakocra. As the avariel have declined, few elven clerics of Aerdrie can fly without magical aid. As a result, many of her priests work to create new spells and items by which magical flight is possible and sometimes given the gift to levitate from the deity herself. Clerics and druids of Aerdrie Faenya pray for their spells at dawn, as the first breeze is felt drifting across the land.   Aerdrie Faenya is worshiped by almost all aarakocra everywhere in Faerûn, and she has been known to appear to them in the form of a brilliant white giant bird. The feathers that fall from her plumage during these apparitions become some of the most treasured items in an aarakocran nest.'),

He gave one group of Corellon''s creations the ability to breathe and live underwater, wishing to see the wisdom and goodness of the elves prevail in the deeper and wilder realms of the sea. He is heavily involved in the constant reshaping of the ocean depths, creating reefs and islands, tinkering with undersea volcanoes and the like.  Deep Sashelas is a political deity; he makes considerable efforts to maintain the unity of the Asathalfinare and is on good terms with non-evil human sea and water deities. He has a special enmity for Sekolah, the sahuagin god and for Panzuriel whom he helped banish and weaken.  Deep Sashelas'' priests have many responsibilities. They act as mediators and befrienders of non evil aquatic races and protectors of dolphins. All priests must take a dolphin companion to progress through the ranks of priesthood. They must also make some effort to establish and maintain contacts with land-dwelling elves if this is feasible. Finally the priests are responsible for creating and maintaining airy caverns below the sea and finding locations which can be used in this way.'),

Having lost his power in the Spellplague, he is now an exarch of Corellon. His titles include the Trickster and the Chameleon.   Erevan is an ever-changing deity, always looking for some exciting new adventure or mischief to engage in. His fun-loving and prankish nature has somewhat strained his relationships with his fellow elven deities, and as a result he spends most of his time with deities who share similar mischievous outlooks. His followers are always looking for new sources of excitement and are notorious adventurers and pranksters. The domains associated with him are Chaos, Elf, Luck, and Trickery. His favored weapon is the short sword.   The erevanian clerics dress in black leather armor with leather caps, and never worship him in the same place twice.'),

He is sullen and withdrawn, offering cynicism and distrust to almost any non-elf who he comes across.  Those most likely to worship Fenmarel Mestarine are pariahs and tribes of wild elves struggling to survive in a world hostile to their kind. The clergy of Fenmarel Mestarine offer training in techniques considered underhanded by some, including poisoning, guerilla warfare, and deception.  Members of Fenmarel Mestarine''s clergy pray at dusk, an analogy to when darkness first settles upon the world. Each independent group of worshipers worships and celebrates their god in their own unique way, a representation of the chaotic nature of a profoundly paranoid deity. '),

She lives in the realm of Arvandor. A being of timeless beauty and benign nature, she always forgives minor transgressions and delights in rewarding her followers with the bliss of unexpected love and affection. She embodies romance, beauty, love, and joy in elven spirits, her only flaws being her own mild vanity and flighty nature. Although she rarely appears to her faithful, Hanali delights in seeing the growth of love among elves, and she often acts in secret to protect young lovers. She was thought for many years to be an aspect of Angharradh, the Triune Goddess, before her true identity as Sune was revealed.  Hanali''s clerics are flighty and somewhat vain, given to dancing and wild celebrations. The hierarchy is loosely organized, and clerics are free to join or leave a temple''s ranks as they wish. They preside over marriage and rites of passage ceremonies for young elves, although they are not required to marry, for Hanali''s concern is love, not necessarily marriage. Members of Hanali''s clergy spend their days cultivating beauty and love in all their myriad forms. Many of Lady Goldheart''s clerics tend fine gardens, while others amass personal or temple-based collections of gems, crystal sculptures, and other fine works of art. While things of gold and crystal, particularly jewelry and statues, are favored, beautiful art in any form is admired, collected, and displayed. Hanali''s clerics must always be finely dressed, and displaying one''s personal beauty to its best advantage is a requirement of every cleric of the Heart of Gold.'),

Together with Sehanine Moonbow he oversees the long life span of the elves and their lives after they have left the mortal realms. His symbol is the setting sun.  He is a philosopher, a patient teacher and instructor, who gives wisdom and knowledge to young and old alike. He is often praised but rarely invoked. Those who worship him are those with an interest in ideas and knowledge, and the changes wrought by the passage of time - sages, historians, philosophers, and librarians.  Labelas'' priests are responsible for educating the young and promoting and acquiring knowledge. They are also record keepers and historians. They meet in groves at sunset to pray, meditate and mark the passing of another day by sharing prayers and knowledge. His clerics typically dress in light gray robes.'),

His priests liken him to a giant ethereal oak tree so huge that its roots mingle with every other plant, which stands in the heart of Arvandor. The great tree draws into itself all the ebb and flow of the season and the lives within the woodlands of the green elves. At the same time it defends and protects those lands against disease, predation and assault of all kinds. The Leaflord is the patron of the Sy''Tel''Quessir and revered by many voadkyn.  The Leaflord is quiet, reflective and enduring over eons unchanged. He is the least flighty of the Seldarine, the least likely to act on a whim, and often grave and self-absorbed. Rillifane''s avatar manifests only rarely, disliking direct action and preferring to act through his priests. When he does, it is usually in response to an attack on an elven (usually Sy''Tel''Quessir) habitat, and is heralded by sudden gusts of winds shaking leaves from trees.  Rillifane Ralathil is said to be a very old deity, older even than Labelas Enoreth, for the great tree would endlessly continue its life without need for eventual death.[1] When the Sy''Tel''Quessir settled in the Yuirwood, the Seldarine merged with the ancient gods of the Yuir, taking them on as aspects of the various powers of the elven pantheon. Magnar the Bear and Relkath of the Infinite Branches became a part of the Leaflord. As a result of these changes, over the centuries since, the Wild One has once more become more primordial in spirit.');
